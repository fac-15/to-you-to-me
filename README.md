# TO YOU TO ME

## To Do:

### BIGGEST GOAL -> CLEARLY NAME EVERYTHING <-

1. User stories :heavy_check_mark: 
2. Re-create HTML page
3. Use a promise ðŸ¤ž (for example, if we need to post to two tables in the same request)
4. Rebuild server
5. Create new routes
- There should be protected routes and unprotected routes that depend on the user having a cookie or not (or what level of access they have).
6. Organise handlers
7. Re-create new database with a couple entries
8. Decide on tables and relationships
9. Login form with 2 fields - username and password
10. Users only have to log in once (i.e. implement a cookie-based session on login)
11. Username is visible on each page of the site after logging in
12. Any user-submitted content should be labelled with the authors username
13. Include thorough tests on the back-end, testing pure functions and testing routes using Supertest. If you make external API calls, use Nock to mock the response for your tests.
14. Test front-end logic, we don't expect tests on the DOM.
15. Encription for login info
